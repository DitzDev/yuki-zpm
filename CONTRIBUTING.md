## Commit Message Guidelines
We use Conventional Commits:
- `feat:` for new features

- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `test:` for adding tests
- `refactor:` for code changes that donâ€™t add features or fix bugs

Example:
```

```

## Code Style
- Follow Go conventions (go fmt, golangci-lint)
- Keep CLI UX consistent with Cargo/npm semantics
- Add unit tests for new functionality

## Reporting Issues
- Please use the GitHub Issues page.
